# React Native: Accessing State Variable Before Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: attempting to access a state variable before it has been properly initialized. This often occurs in asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to fix it using asynchronous operations and conditional rendering.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run the app.
4. Observe the error in the console.
5. Examine the `bugSolution.js` file to see how the error is fixed.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully managing the asynchronous operation and ensuring the state variable is accessed only after it's been updated. This can be accomplished through conditional rendering or the use of `useEffect` hooks.
