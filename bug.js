This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This is common in asynchronous operations, where the state might not be updated immediately after an API call or other asynchronous task.  For example, if you have a state variable `userData` that is fetched from an API, and you try to access it before the API call completes, you will get an error similar to `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')`.  This is because the `userData` is `undefined` until the API call returns data and updates the state.
